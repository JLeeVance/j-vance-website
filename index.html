                <a class="bio">To be honest, this type of introduction doesn't typically capture 'the whole human'. I can't quite reconcile that. I am an artist, and it's in my nature to express myself openly, even to someone I don't know. Would you believe me if I told you that when I sing, my mind becomes still? Or that when I immerse myself in creating tactile art, I move with a frenetic energy that somehow brings me calmness?
                    What about this, no matter what I do, where I go, or who I am with my brain is continuously evaluating life around me? Art imitates life, and thus I am drawn to learn and evolve from my surroundings. That drive is what has led me to where I am today; interacting with you. So thanks for checking in on my journey, come back soon. </a>
